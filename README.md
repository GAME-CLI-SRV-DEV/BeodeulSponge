# BeodeulSponge
Another Cat-Memorial Server Software. this time, it uses sponge. we cannot develop this unless we put Geyser in it.

# This Project Belongs to NogyangSpigot Team.
We Tried to Implement Sponge and Bukkit in one software and it failed.
so it split up into NogyangSpigot <-> BeodeulSponge & also i was crap at making forks at 2022-2023.
but now the time has come. we will unite the Minecraft Community Once and For all!
