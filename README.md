# BeodeulSponge
Another Cat-Memorial Server Software. this time, it uses sponge. we cannot develop this unless we put Geyser in it.

# This Project Belongs to NogyangSpigot Team.
We Tried to Implement Sponge and Bukkit in one software and it failed.
so it split up into NogyangSpigot <-> BeodeulSponge & also i was crap at making forks at 2022-2023.
but now the time has come. we will unite the Minecraft Community Once and For all!

# ALERT!
Geyser-Sponge, the library to develop the BeodeulSponge Has Been Deprecated and Removed in future geyser versions.
The Following Code Snippet has been removed due to the [Pull Request That Removes Sponge Plugin Version of Geyser](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/pull/4097):
```
compileonly("org.geysermc.geyser:api:2.2.3-SNAPSHOT")
```
Replaced with 
```
Implementation("org.geysermc.geyser:core:2.3.1-SNAPSHOT")
Implementation("org.geysermc.floodgate:core:2.2.3-SNAPSHOT")
```
this version of the plugin will use the GeyserMC. the plugin only belongs to this Server Repository.
this version also uses gradle.
